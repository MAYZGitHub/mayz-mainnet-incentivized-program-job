## **🚀 MAYZ Index Fund Module Is Live — And We're Launching a New Incentives Campaign\!**

After the successful deployment of our **Governance Fund Module**, it's time to unveil the second pillar of the MAYZ Protocol: the **Index Fund Module**, now available on **mainnet**. Alongside this, we’re launching a **community incentives campaign** to boost adoption and reward early users.

Before, let’s check the outcomes achieved so far.

### **✅ Governance Fund KPIs: Mission Accomplished**

In just two months:

* ✅ **333k ADA in TVL**

* ✅ **122k $gMAYZ minted**

* ✅ **98% of liquidity providers** joined by minting gMAYZ

* ✅ **Secondary market liquidity grew from 92k to 170k ADA**

## **🧠 What’s the Index Fund Module?**

The **Index Fund Module** is designed to enable the creation of **passive investment strategies**, offering a **simple and diversified way to gain exposure to the growth of the Cardano ecosystem**.

Investors can access diversified funds **easily by purchasing with ADA**. To make this possible, the protocol allows the **decentralized creation of these investment instruments**, putting powerful financial tools in the hands of the community.

The Module allows anyone to become a Fund Manager by locking 500 $gMAYZ, gaining governance rights and helping strengthen the liquidity of the MAYZ token.

Each manager can launch a fund based on any thesis or allocation strategy. Once live, the fund issues a Fund Token (FT), which investors can buy directly or access via swap offers. Additionally, Fund Managers earn fees from deposits, while $gMAYZ holders who delegate to these funds also share in the revenue.

Finally, **liquidity providers can create swap offers for any fund they like**, helping investors enter positions easily while earning yield by **providing liquidity**.

**More funds → more demand for $gMAYZ → deeper protocol liquidity.**

## **🎯 Mainnet Playground: Let’s Test Together\!**

To showcase the feature, we launched two funds for you to buy & hold, and provide liquidity:

* **CDEX** – Exposure to top decentralized exchanges on Cardano

* **CTOOL** – Exposure to top Tools & infrastructure projects with strong utility

And now… **we invite the community to participate and earn rewards** 🎁

Complete tasks, accumulate points, and get a share of a pool of at least **FALTA CANTIDAD** **$gMAYZ rewards worth 10,000 ADA** — or even more if adoption skyrockets\!

### **📌 Tasks & Points**

| Task \# | Task | Description | Points |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | **Registration** | Buy $gMAYZ (min 100 $gMAYZ) and post it on X. | Registration |
| **2** | **Swap Offers** | Create Swap Offers (min 500 ADA value in FT) and keep them active till campaign ending | 1 ADA \= 2 Point  |
| **3** | **Hold Fund Tokens** | Buy Fund Tokens & hold them till campaign ending | 1 ADA \= 1 Point |
| **4** | **Stake $gMAYZ** | Stake $gMAYZ in a Fund and keep them staked till campaign ending | 1 gMAYZ \= 2 points  |
| **5** | **Give Feedback** | Complete the Google form with valuable feedback | 5% additional points |

Task 2, 3 & 4 can accrue 4,000 points max each.

Example: 

If you create a Swap Offer with 500 ADA in value, buy & hold 500 ADA in FT & stake 600 $gMAYZ, you will get 1000 points for the offer, 500 points for the buy & hold and 1200 points for staking $gMAYZ, Total: 2700 points. If you give feedback you get 135 additional points, accruing 2,835 points.

### **🧮 Points Multiplier: gMAYZ Holding Boost**

Your total score is **multiplied** by the amount of $gMAYZ you hold (up to 1,000 units of $gMAYZ)\!

Example:  
2,835 base points × 600 $gMAYZ → **1,701,000 final points**

More $gMAYZ \= Bigger rewards 💥

All holdings, FT, Swap Offers & $gMAYZ, to be eligible will be snapshoted at the end of the program.
